Creating your own snippets
You can define your own snippets, either global snippets or snippets for a specific language. To open up a snippet file for editing, select User Snippets under File > Preferences (Code > Preferences on macOS) and select the language (by language identifier) for which the snippets should appear or create a new global snippet (New Global Snippets file).


Copy These simple Snippets into your snippets file.
